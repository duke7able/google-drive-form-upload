Submit any thing you want, imagination is the limit, create a branch from develop and do that, and label it properly.

One thing that irritates and is total rejection is bad, very bad commit messages. dont do that for straight deletion.

branch name should be something like : feature/feature-purpose or bug/bug-what or featureFix/addition-to-incomplete-feature

commites should be something like fix : blah blah blah i fixed it. Or something like feat : this is the module which should be in !!

### If you forget everything from it, does not matter, pr string should be proper atleast, otherwise its straight rejected
